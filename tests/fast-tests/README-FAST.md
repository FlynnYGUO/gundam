# Validation scripts that run quickly

This directory contains scripts that will be run as part of the
gundam-tests.sh fast tests.  Each script should finish in a "few"
seconds so they can be run as part of a normal build.  See the
gundam-tests.sh script for documentation on the file naming
convention.

This file should exist so that git will create the fast-tests
subdirectory

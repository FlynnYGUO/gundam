# Validation scripts for gundam-tests.sh

This directory contains scripts that are not run as part of the
gundam-tests.sh fast tests.  Each script should probably finish within
a "few" minutes, but there is no particular time limit.  See the
gundam-tests.sh script for documentation on the file naming
convention.

This file should exist so that git will create the slow-tests
subdirectory
